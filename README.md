# App: Pass the Class
We designed a mobile application as a personal project called Pass the Class.

It can be difficult for students to keep track of their grades, as many university platforms don’t explicitly display final grades. The goal of this mobile application is to design a user-friendly platform for students to input, manage, organize and predict grades. 

Our app calculates grades using the user’s input of percentage per category and individual assignment grades. This includes a functional profile system, multiple tabs for various classes, and inputs for percentages per category. 

Add-on features: username/password,  image recognition, input for university/class to show grade distribution and percentage per category, chatrooms for subjects/classes, predict individual assignment/test grades, show data visualizations of grades

Tech Stack: 
Flutter- user friendly, installations for iOS and android devices, cross-platform UI; can reuse code across various operating systems such as iOS and Android
Firebase ML Kit - text recognition (for future use)
Flask -  Backend for user data (for future use)
